/**
 * Jest Mock for next-safe-action
 *
 * This mock uses safemocker to provide a fully functional mock of next-safe-action
 * that works in Jest environments where ESM modules cannot be directly imported.
 *
 * This file is automatically used by Jest when next-safe-action is imported.
 *
 * This demonstrates the ONE-LINE setup that users should use:
 * ```typescript
 * // __mocks__/next-safe-action.ts
 * export * from '@jsonbored/safemocker/jest/mock';
 * ```
 */

export * from '@jsonbored/safemocker/jest/mock';
